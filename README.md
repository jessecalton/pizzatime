# PizzaThyme

### [Click here for demo!](https://pizzathyme.netlify.app/)

This project uses React 16.12, and takes full advantage of those sweet React Hooks.

The project also uses both class-based and functional components, and uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for navigational purposes.

It uses [Axios](<[https://github.com/axios/axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)>) + async/await to parse real-time data from the [Arizmendi Bakery pizza menu](<[https://arizmendibakery.com/pizza](https://arizmendibakery.com/pizza)>), which updates daily, and won't crash on Sundays or Mondays when Arizmendi Bakery is closed.

### Fun Things You Can Do With It

- If you select more than 3 cheeses, it tacks on a \$2 donation to the Human Fund, and you get a neat surprise when you order your pizza.
- You can't order a pizza until you've selected a crust and a topping or cheese. Basically, you _have_ to get creative. Go wild!
- Order a lovely cheese pizza. [Just for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RISQc8mptK4)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
